Not only did Frida Kahlo paint her personal struggle in a male dominated art world at the time, she also had her own body as a battlefield as a lifelong companion. Seeing her costumes and corsets in 2015 at her house made me realise just how she used these as an armour and a weapon. Her personal belongings and clothing are shown for the first time outside Mexico after having been locked away for 50 years.

I got bullied a lot about my gap teeth, I pretty much hated more features about me as a result as time went by and the insecurities manifested into something bigger then myself. darkness just consumed every part of me cause I allowed someone that isn\u2019t even in my life anymore define my own structure of what God made, are you mad? I\u2019m giving someone power over me. are you normal? are you? are you normal?\nI don\u2019t care what people think, in actual fact I don\u2019t let nobody else have power over me. your words can\u2019t destroy a part of me that was built up through love. smiling and making jokes to people was just an ice breaker to laugh away the pain, it\u2019s not pain anymore. it\u2019s joy. it\u2019s happiness in its purest form. it\u2019s my tool, not my weapon. \nI smile now and embrace what God gave me. I made peace with my past, and I move forward. I smile now and I bring joy to peoples lives cause without people, we won\u2019t be here. so smile and show the world what you\u2019re made of. what\u2019s there to fear but fear itself? move through, move on, and move beyond. \nyou got this. and oh yeah, smile :relaxed:\n#FirstOfAllILookFuckingBuff #IfYouThinkOtherwiseYoureBlindAndYouShouldGoToSpecsavers #IFinallyFoundSelfLoveWithinMyself #AllMyFriendsKnowThisJourneyHasBeenMad #PrayersWorks #YouJustHaveToBelieveInItAndWorkHard #AreYouSeeingThatHaircutThough #PlusCainrowsAsWell #ImTakingThePiss #BruhMyHairdressersIsRightNextDoorToMyBarber #ThatsHowDeepTheConnectionRuns #AgainIJustWannaSayImBuff #ImFinishedNow #ActuallyIllNeverBeFinished #MySauceWillOverfow #YoureGonnaBeSickOfMeAndIDontGiveAShit #JustLookAtMeNow #WatchMeGlow","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BgEWqWsBK50\/","source":null,"sub_type":"image","sequence":450383335,"created_original_date":"2018-03-08 15:55:50","created_original_timezone":"+00:00","language":"en","geo_long":"-0.11508022460300","geo_lat":"51.46050546640000","formatted_address":"St Matthew's Church, Windrush Square, Stockwell, London Borough of Lambeth, London, Greater London, England, SW2 1JQ, UK","city":"London","state_code":"ENGLAND","country_code":"GB","postal_code":"SW2 1JQ","content_sentiment":"0.32","original_id":"1730607824419204724_1486115725","media":"https:\/\/scontent.cdninstagram.com\/vp\/3211ee153cc9a2dac0a182e1e7cbee56\/5B3BBC5E\/t51.2885-15\/sh0.08\/e35\/p640x640\/28427281_1187719241364093_1570334506928308224_n.jpg","geolocation_level":"point"}},{"author":{"author_service_id":"3610909895","avatar":"https:\/\/scontent.cdninstagram.com\/vp\/d8dcf4fd61e1736bf87541f65f2418a7\/5B4736C5\/t51.2885-19\/s150x150\/25015796_134041130624489_7232501588164608000_n.jpg","link":"https:\/\/instagram.com\/dlp_films\/","name":"DLP FIlms | London | :flag_gb:","username":"dlp_films","author_language":"en","interaction_type":"instagram","time_zone":"GMT","utc":"+00:00"},"interaction":{"internal_id":450486327,"internal_created":"2018-03-08 19:31:55","interaction_type":"instagram","content":"Another shoot down operating on a commercial with my long time brother @edgibbs82. @djironin2 this time taking the Red Weapon, Angenieux 28-76mm, LMB25, UMC4 brain (:rolling_eyes:) and teradek in over slung mode\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#djironin #ronin2 #gimbal #gimbaloperator #commercial @redcamerausers #weapon #angenieux #wcu4 #camera #cameraoperator #cameradept #ronin #film #filmmaking","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BgEvVNojMm3\/","source":null,"sub_type":"image","sequence":450486327,"created_original_date":"2018-03-08 19:31:24","created_original_timezone":"+00:00","language":"en","geo_long":"-0.26661157608000","geo_lat":"51.53188105980000","formatted_address":"Kinetic Enterprises Ltd., Acton Lane, Acton, London Borough of Ealing, London, Greater London, England, NW10 7FY, UK","city":"London","state_code":"ENGLAND","country_code":"GB","postal_code":"NW10 7FY","content_sentiment":"0.26","original_id":"1730716322751105463_3610909895","media":"https:\/\/scontent.cdninstagram.com\/vp\/d237f39c4f4130c8a41523e9fad7f3c8\/5B44908C\/t51.2885-15\/s640x640\/sh0.08\/e35\/28427297_801043206747334_5131949601858781184_n.jpg","geolocation_level":"point"}}],"remainder_posts":472}
